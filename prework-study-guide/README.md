# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this guide filled with notes using HTML, CSS and Javascript. These notes will help any student with brief information about the prework module. Not only are the notes on a webpage for easy access, but in doing so I also learned to create the webpage itself in the process.

## Installation

## Usage

The guide is filled with notes taken from the prework course. Each section is labeled with a certain topic. Opening the DevTools console will list the topics we learned from the course and choose one topic for us to study first.
